# Dragome contributor licence agreement
At Dragome, we are required to have agreements with everyone who takes part. 
It's the easiest way for you to give us permission to use your contributions. 
In effect, you are giving us a licence, but you still own the copyright â€” so you retain the right to modify your code and use it in other projects.


# Sign the contributor agreement

When you're ready to contribute to Dragome, we have two forms: one for individual contributors and one for companies and other organisations. 
Please complete the appropriate form.

We use the Harmony CLA to protect your rights regarding any contribution you make to our open source projects. 
Learn more about how it works and what it means for you.
