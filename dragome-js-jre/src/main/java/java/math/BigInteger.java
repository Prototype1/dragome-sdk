/**
 * Immutable arbitrary-precision integers.  All operations behave as if
 * BigIntegers were represented in two's-complement notation (like Java's
 * primitive integer types).  BigInteger provides analogues to all of Java's
 * primitive integer operators, and all relevant methods from java.lang.Math.
 * Additionally, BigInteger provides operations for modular arithmetic, GCD
 * calculation, primality testing, prime generation, bit manipulation,
 * and a few other miscellaneous operations.
 *
 * <p>Semantics of arithmetic operations exactly mimic those of Java's integer
 * arithmetic operators, as defined in <i>The Java Language Specification</i>.
 * For example, division by zero throws an {@code ArithmeticException}, and
 * division of a negative by a positive yields a negative (or zero) remainder.
 * All of the details in the Spec concerning overflow are ignored, as
 * BigIntegers are made as large as necessary to accommodate the results of an
 * operation.
 *
 * <p>Semantics of shift operations extend those of Java's shift operators
 * to allow for negative shift distances.  A right-shift with a negative
 * shift distance results in a left shift, and vice-versa.  The unsigned
 * right shift operator ({@code >>>}) is omitted, as this operation makes
 * little sense in combination with the "infinite word size" abstraction
 * provided by this class.
 *
 * <p>Semantics of bitwise logical operations exactly mimic those of Java's
 * bitwise integer operators.  The binary operators ({@code and},
 * {@code or}, {@code xor}) implicitly perform sign extension on the shorter
 * of the two operands prior to performing the operation.
 *
 * <p>Comparison operations perform signed integer comparisons, analogous to
 * those performed by Java's relational and equality operators.
 *
 * <p>Modular arithmetic operations are provided to compute residues, perform
 * exponentiation, and compute multiplicative inverses.  These methods always
 * return a non-negative result, between {@code 0} and {@code (modulus - 1)},
 * inclusive.
 *
 * <p>Bit operations operate on a single bit of the two's-complement
 * representation of their operand.  If necessary, the operand is sign-
 * extended so that it contains the designated bit.  None of the single-bit
 * operations can produce a BigInteger with a different sign from the
 * BigInteger being operated on, as they affect only a single bit, and the
 * "infinite word size" abstraction provided by this class ensures that there
 * are infinitely many "virtual sign bits" preceding each BigInteger.
 *
 * <p>For the sake of brevity and clarity, pseudo-code is used throughout the
 * descriptions of BigInteger methods.  The pseudo-code expression
 * {@code (i + j)} is shorthand for "a BigInteger whose value is
 * that of the BigInteger {@code i} plus that of the BigInteger {@code j}."
 * The pseudo-code expression {@code (i == j)} is shorthand for
 * "{@code true} if and only if the BigInteger {@code i} represents the same
 * value as the BigInteger {@code j}."  Other pseudo-code expressions are
 * interpreted similarly.
 *
 * <p>All methods and constructors in this class throw
 * {@code NullPointerException} when passed
 * a null object reference for any input parameter.
