/**
 * Provides default implementations of {@link ExecutorService}
 * execution methods. This class implements the <tt>submit</tt>,
 * <tt>invokeAny</tt> and <tt>invokeAll</tt> methods using a
 * {@link RunnableFuture} returned by <tt>newTaskFor</tt>, which defaults
 * to the {@link FutureTask} class provided in this package.  For example,
 * the implementation of <tt>submit(Runnable)</tt> creates an
 * associated <tt>RunnableFuture</tt> that is executed and
 * returned. Subclasses may override the <tt>newTaskFor</tt> methods
 * to return <tt>RunnableFuture</tt> implementations other than
 * <tt>FutureTask</tt>.
 *
 * <p> <b>Extension example</b>. Here is a sketch of a class
 * that customizes {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} to use
 * a <tt>CustomTask</tt> class instead of the default <tt>FutureTask</tt>:
 *  <pre> {@code
 * public class CustomThreadPoolExecutor extends ThreadPoolExecutor {
 *
 *   static class CustomTask<V> implements RunnableFuture<V> {...}
 *
 *   protected <V> RunnableFuture<V> newTaskFor(Callable<V> c) {
 *       return new CustomTask<V>(c);
 *   }
 *   protected <V> RunnableFuture<V> newTaskFor(Runnable r, V v) {
 *       return new CustomTask<V>(r, v);
 *   }
 *   // ... add constructors, etc.
 * }}</pre>
